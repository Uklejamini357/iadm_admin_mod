## 2. Config
Configuring the can be quite complex. Currently, it's quite limited too. In future there may be more configuration options.<br><br>

The command goes like this:<br>
> iadm_config [config category] [config option] [value]


## 3. UserGroups

UserGroups are a vital part of the admin mod. It helps especially who is a part of the staff team, etc. Thanks to the usergroup powerlevel system, it is more simple to use in general.

Note: While you can use commands on targetted player with equal to or lower than your power level, you can't target players with certain commands (especially kick, ban, mute, etc.) with their power level equal to or higher than yours.
