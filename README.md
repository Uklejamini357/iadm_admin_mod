# IADM - Incomprehensibly Advanced Distributed Management Mod

# Questions and Answers

### How do I use this mod?
Simply type in "iadm" in console and add a space after it. You will notice a list of usable commands below the console command prompt.

### Missing permissions when using a command.
The command is likely restricted to be usable for admins only, or you are not superadmin.<br>

### Writing out full player names is a pain in the ass. Any other way to shorten it?
Sure. In most cases, you don't have to write out a full player nickname.<br>
To target yourself, you can always use ^<br>
To target a player under your crosshair, use @ (works on entities as well!)

### Why did you decide to make a new admin mod?
ULX felt too outdated, despite it being powerful, lacked any versatile customization options. SAM, while being a simple mod, is a paid mod. Other alternatives like xAdmin lacked extensibility and FAdmin being DarkRP focused only. IADM on the other hand, will remain highly customizable and extensible with the help of toggleable modules, addons, etc.

### There is no UI for the mod yet. When will UI update be coming?
I have no plans for making UI yet. For now, stick to using console commands and chat commands.

### Why did you choose Srlion's Hook Library as a dependency?
It's super fast and versatile. Oh, and it's faster than ULib, too.

### Will this addon be paid?
Absolutely not. I have no intentions, nor any plans to make IADM a paid mod, as it will stick to being open source only.


# Troubleshooting!

### I accidentally made myself non-admin and can't get myself back to superadmin!
If you're on a local listen server, you can simply use "iadm_god_mode" commmand to disable permission checks for you, allowing to use any command on any group. Otherwise, on a dedicated server, use the server console instead. Technically, this shouldn't happen as this addon prevents you from setting yourself to a group with lower powerlevel to prevent yourself from losing access to important commands and functionality.
